If you downloaded the mod from GitHub you will need to do this:
1. Once you finish unziping the .zip file in mod folder rename the folder called "Greater-Project-Mod-vx.x.x" to "GPM"
2. Move the .mod file called "GPM.mod" inside the "GPM" folder into your game/mod folder
3. clean up deleting this file and the .zip one and enjoy the mod!
