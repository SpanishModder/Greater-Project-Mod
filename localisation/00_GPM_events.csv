EVTNAME50007;The St. Petersburg Treaty;x;
EVTDESC50007;The efforts for the negotiation of the Kuril Islands and the island of Sakhalin by the Russian empire and ours have led to the fact that we can include half of these territories to our nation through an equitable treaty and without anyone obtaining more territory than the other.;x;
EVTOPTA50007;Accept the treaty;x;
EVTOPTB50007;Don't accept the treaty;x;
EVTNAME50100;The Death of Tsar Alexander III;x;

The chosen one to take this charge will be Nicholas II, that will reign Russia for a long time starting now. We are pleased of having this tsar nowadays, because most of monarchies nowadays are falling down and our country will be the exception... Long live to the new ruler of our country!;x;
EVTOPTA50100;Long live to Tsar Nicholas II of Russia!;x;
EVTNAME50200;The Oriental Crisis;x;
EVTDESC50200;In the preceding decades, Muhammad Ali had expanded and strengthened his hold on Ottoman territory, beginning with Egypt where he acted as a viceroy for the Sultan. Called upon to assist the Ottomans in the Greek War of Independence, Muhammad Ali in return demanded parts of Ottoman Syria to be transferred to his personal rule. When the war ended and the Porte failed to keep its promise, Muhammad Ali launched a military campaign against his Ottoman masters and easily took most of the Syrian lands.;x;
EVTOPTA50200;Raise the Egyptian flags!;x;
EVTNAME50201;Egypt Proclaims it's independence;x;
EVTDESC50201;Mohamed Ali has done his thing in Egypt and now he is about to proclaim his independence over us, this is due to the tolerance of our government in Egypt, allowing decisions to be made that a vassal like Egypt should not take alone, that is why we must restore the order in all provinces that were once Ottoman.;x;
EVTOPTA50201;We must restore order in Egypt;x;
EVTOPTB50201;Negotiate with them;x;
EVTNAME50202;The Ottoman Empire accepts our demands;x;
EVTDESC50202;After a long wait, we can finally proclaim our independence, of course, relative, since the Ottomans demand us to return the Middle Eastern territories to them... We can also reject their proposals, but we will risk losing a certain war with them;x;
EVTOPTA50202;Accept their demands;x;
EVTOPTB50202;Reject their demands;x;
EVTNAME50203;Egypt Refuses our demands!;x;
EVTDESC50203;The Egyptians have rejected our generous peace offer, this cannot be allowed and must be condemned. Egypt has only a few days of independence left and will soon return to being a vassal of our mighty and prosperous nation. Long live the Ottoman Empire;x;
EVTOPTA50203;Long live to the Ottoman Empire!;x;
EVTNAME50204;Egypt Surrenders!;x;
EVTDESC50204;In 1839, the Ottoman Empire attempted to retake Syria from Muhammad Ali but was defeated by his son, Ibrahim Pasha in the Battle of Nezib. Thus, a new war between Muhammad Ali and the Ottomans escalated, with the latter failing once again to wage it successfully. In June 1840, the entire Ottoman navy defected to Muhammad Ali, and the French planned to offer full support to his cause.;x;
EVTOPTA50204;A good day for our nation;x;
EVTOPTB50204;We need entire Egypt;x;
EVTNAME50205;Treaty of Damasco;x;
EVTOPTA50205;Sign the Treaty;x;
EVTNAME50300;The $CAPITAL$ Conference of $YEAR$;x;
EVTDESC50300;The colonial powers of the world have gathered in $CAPITAL$ to discuss the regulation of colonization and trade in Africa. The outcome has become known as the 'General Act of the $CAPITAL$ Conference', formalizing the scramble for the African continent. After this point, any civilized country will largely be seen as justified in aggression towards uncivilized African nations.;x;
EVTOPTA50300;We must Colonize all of Africa;x;
EVTNAME50400;The Hungarian Revolt;x;
EVTDESC50400;A war rages in the Austrian Empire as Hungary attempt to secede from the Union. The outcome is uncertain, but already this promises to be a new type of war as both sides have access to railroads, telegraphs, and repeating rifles. Meanwhile, Great Britain is experimenting with the first iron-hulled steam-driven warship, a combination which promises to revolutionise the war at sea. World wide the industrial revolution is gathering speed as more and more nations start to industrialise. The times they are changing for our nation.;x;

EVTOPTB50600;Do not sign a treaty;x;
EVTOPTC50600;Declare war on USA;x;
BALKANWARSDESC;The Balkan area has always been a challenge for us to maintain armed peace, it seems that the countries that managed to gain full independence from us have defrauded us and demanded that we give up our Balkan territories and thus avoid a war, we are willing to have Turkish territories taken from us?;x;
EVTNAME50700;The Spanish Constitution of 1837;x;
EVTDESC50700;The independence of America has led to a general discontent of the Spanish population, our political advisers have done everything possible to calm this constant pressure from the monarchy. The only thing left for us is to approve the constitution of 1812...;x;
EVTOPTA50700;Aprove the constitution;x;
EVTOPTB50700;We don't need a simple piece of paper!;x;
EVTNAME50501;Our Lands Returned!;x;

EVTDESC50800;The Peru-Bolivian Confederation has collapsed and has asked us for a peace offer, our country will finally be a united and independent nation. In addition to achieving total independence, we will also demand the annexation of southern Peru so that we can be a nation with great prestige, a small step for the Great Peruvian nation!;x;
EVTOPTB50800;Peru is finally United!;x;
EVTNAME50801;The Peruvian Demands;x;
EVTOPTB50801;We have no choice;x;
EVTNAME50601;Mexico Surrenders;x;
EVTDESC50601;The now Mexican Empire has surrendered to us and from now on it will be an empire that will rise from the ashes and that is why we have expectations that it will surpass the previous Mexican Empire, which was a failure due to its instability.;x;
EVTOPTA50601;Welcome to the Second Mexican Empire!;x;
EVTNAME50102;The Crimean Incident;x;
EVTDESC50102;The constant influence in the Ottoman territory has led to increased tensions between the two countries, our objectives are to liberate the Romanian peoples of Moldavia and Wallachia, in addition to further weakening the Ottoman army;x;

EVTOPTA50404;The Territory of Venetia is ours;x;
EVTNAME50103;The Ottoman Empire Surrenders;x;
EVTDESC50103;Some time ago we began to invade the Ottoman Empire and after the advance of our excellent troops, we have been able to determine our territory in strategic areas that have forced the Ottoman Empire to sign peace with us, determining the beginning of the Romanian monarchy;x;
EVTOPTA50103;Fine!;x;
CRIMEANWARDESC;In what is perhaps a foolish move, the French have pressure the Turks into accepting their sovereign authority over the Holy Land in Palestine... authority which has traditionally rested with the Russians since the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca. The question simply remains whether we should interfere. While holy sites are not our concern, trade routes through the Levant lead to India... and a Russian war with the Turks could directly threaten our interests. We can support the russians and end our political influence in the ottomans or we can support the ottomans and secure our trades of oil and tea;x;
EVTNAME50900;The Crimean War Question;x;
EVTOPTA50900;We support the Ottomans;x;

EVTNAME50901;France Demands Savoy;x;
EVTDESC50901;France demands the region of Savoy as a reward for the Italian war of unification against Austria, so it will gain nuclei in the region yes or yes, but we can give it the territories for good or run the risk of starting a war against our northern neighbors...;x;
EVTOPTA50901;Give Savoy to France;x;
EVTOPTB50901;Ignore the demands;x;
EVTNAME50104;Sweeden Demands Finland;x;
EVTDESC50104;Sweden with the help of Finland demands that our sub-state be independent before our glorious empire, we cannot allow such a threat against us, Tsar, we must give them a life lesson so that they leave us in peace with their territorial ambitions.;x;
EVTOPTA50104;Accept the Demands;x;
EVTOPTB50104;Declare War on Finland;x;
EVTNAME50105;Transcaucasian Revolt!;x;
EVTDESC50105;Some time ago we annexed one of the Russian autonomies as a consequence of being so inefficient and because of the war we are currently having they rebel against us because they want more autonomy or even demand total independence, this is inadmissible, we must end them once and for all.;x;
EVTOPTA50105;We can't allow this rebellion!;x;
EVTNAME51000;$FROMCOUNTRY$ calls the Patagonian Convention;x;
EVTDESC51000;Since our independence from Spain, the borders have never been clear in the region of Patagonia and despite our efforts to resolve it diplomatically it had not been possible until now, our neighbors have assured us of creating a treaty on equal terms in their capital, Buenos Aires, what should we do?;x;
EVTOPTA51000;Accept the proposal;x;
EVTOPTC51000;Don't accept the proposal;x;
EVTOPTB51000;Purpose other demands;x;
EVTNAME51001;They Accept!;x;
EVTDESC51001;Since our independence from Spain, the borders have never been clear in the region of Patagonia and despite our efforts to resolve it diplomatically, it had not been possible until now, that is why we must assure our neighbors that we will create a fair treaty for the two countries...;x;
EVTOPTA51001;Claim our Lands!;x;
EVTNAME50405;The Krakowian Uprising;x;
EVTDESC50405;Since 1836, our army has occupied the city of krakow and therefore the entire country, our little neighbor asks us to leave his country free of our troops and influence, so we assume that it is a provocation for our empire and therefore we must declare the war to krakow;x;
EVTOPTA50405;We can't allow this provocation!;x;
EVTOPTB50405;Now It isn't the moment;x;
EVTNAME50302;The War is over!;x;
EVTDESC50302;We lose the war with the european country and we have to lose one of our country's ports...;x;

EVTOPTB50107;Support the Russians;x;
EVTDESC50106;A long time ago, we conquered the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth together with Prussia, so it is clear that both Poles and Lithuanians live in that region, this rebellion has led us to think if we should set them free or conquer them and return them to our glorious country with our Tsar of maximum state power...;x;
EVTNAME50701;The Carlist War;x;
EVTDESC50701;The Carlist war is still ongoing and we cannot allow it to continue to be a guerrilla war that kills many Spaniards every month, we must put an end to this war but we will have to choose one of the options, we must sacrifice ourselves for our country and not throw waste thousands of lives unnecessarily, we must act now somehow...;x;
EVTOPTA50701;Put Carlos in the throne!;x;

EVTOPTB51002;This cannot be allowed!;x;
EVTNAME51003;The Chaco Crisis;x;
EVTDESC51003;The Chaco region has always been a question mark for the countries that surround it since we have never reached an agreement in which we can solve this problem... Now that we have been asked to collaborate with each other, we must take advantage of it in one way or another other;x;

EVTNAME50008;The Shogun Win The War!;x;
EVTDESC50008;Our different sub-states have tried to overthrow our absolute government to establish an imperialist one even more absolute than ours, but once Kyoto was occupied we were able to end the war and announce the total unification of the islands of Japan into a single nation governed by the shogun;x;
EVTOPTA50008;Welcome to the Shogunate Japan!;x;
EVTNAME50406;The End of our Empire;x;
EVTDESC50406;The different attacks on our nation have caused immense losses of territory, and have caused our empire to become a weak country that cannot even maintain its territory, the recent fall of our capital has dealt the last blow to our empire to that it be completely destroyed... From now on, the Austrian Empire will go down in the history books and cease to be as we know it right now;x;
EVTOPTA50406;Good bye old Austria;x;
EVTNAME50502;Monarchist Coup;x;
EVTDESC50502;Some time ago we made a decision to promote the absolute monarchy and the members of the reactionary party have carried out a coup against our nation, what should we do to combat the constant revolts?;x;

EVTNAME50108;The Death of Tsar Nicholas I;x;
EVTDESC50108;In recent years, our Tsar has experienced a seemingly incurable disease that has given our leader no other chance of life.

Glory to the new Emperor Alexander II of Russia!;x;
EVTOPTA50108;Long live to Tsar Alexander II of Russia!;x;
OPIUMWARDESC;The constant tensions between the two countries have led someone to make the decision to declare war on the other, the tensions have led to a large-scale war that will lead to thousands or millions of deaths for both one side and the other, this should happen at any time unless some mutual agreement is reached.;x;

EVTNAME51302;Indian rebels declare their Independence!;x;
EVTDESC51302;Lately there have been several revolts in the area of the Indies and as expected, the rebels have proclaimed an independent state from our empire, they call it "La India" and they have no intention of ever belonging to our empire again. We should bring English order to the Indies again and organize the territory of our colonies in another way to avoid future revolts.;x;
EVTNAME51800;Capitalism in $COUNTRY$;x;
EVTDESC51800;The different recent events in our country and environment have led capitalists to emerge and finance future factory projects for our civilization, we do not rule out that it is an attempt to abuse power against our country but money is money...;x;
EVTOPTA51800;Accept the money;x;
EVTOPTB51800;Refuse the money;x;
EVTNAME50503;The $CAPITAL$ Treaty;x;
EVTDESC50503;After a long war against great powers, we have signed peace and they have required us to completely dismantle our empire, this will add several problems to us and will aggravate others that we already had in the war. Anyway, at least our country has survived and has not disappeared...;x;

EVTNAME50504;The Collapse of $FROMCOUNTRY$;x;

EVTOPTB50109;We can't annex the state;x;
EVTNAME50211;The Collapse of Egypt;x;
EVTDESC50211;The Egyptians have been holding out longer than expected and now that the country's government has collapsed, we must take advantage and restore order to the country.

EVTNAME51603;The Beijing Treaty;x;

EVTNAME50407;The Danubian Proposal;x;
EVTDESC50407;This territorial and social unification could lead to greater stability in the national territory in addition to ensuring an important position in Austrian politics and the option of being able to carry out our own reforms in our sub-state territory.;x;

EVTNAME51102;The Gold Rush;x;
EVTDESC51102;The recent arrivals of immigrants in our country have caused an increase in the search for the long-awaited American gold, recent reports of these searches affirm that they have found gold, a lot of gold, as much gold as for the offer to the US general staff.

EVTOPTA51102;For the Gold!;x;
EVTNAME51605;The Warlord Era;x;
EVTDESC51605;Resistance against the $CAPITAL$ government has culminated in a breakdown in authority. What began with several of the outlying warlords declaring their independence has ended with the most powerful generals in the Beiyang Army struggling for control. A contest has begun regarding who will control the future of China's destiny, and most are certain it will not be long before the entire nation is engulfed in war.;x;
EVTOPTA51605;The Chinese will be united again!;x;
EVTNAME51604;The Chinese Restoration;x;
EVTDESC51604;The Chinese nation has always been divided between breakaway dynasties and other kingdoms. Now that we have become civilized, we can unify all the territory where there are Chinese people and create a pleasant atmosphere in a new and neutral nation called "China", which will be ruled by the rising Qing dynasty, but now with a more democratic and faithful system for the Europeans...;x;
EVTNAME51606;The Xinhai Revolution;x;
EVTDESC51606;The constant threats against us in xinhai have led the separatists to declare an independent state which will worsen the stability of the country. Anyway, the rebellion won't last long, let's hope...;x;
EVTNAME5607;The New Chinese Army;x;
EVTDESC51607;For a long time, the Chinese have been one of the countries with an army superior to our enemies, but in the absence of modernization, we have lost many wars that, with the recent modernization of other countries, would be even worse wars. That is why we have devised a modernization of the Chinese army...;x;
